note right of HFHub
  Central repository for:
  - Model weights and configurations
  - Tokenizer vocabularies
  - Model cards and documentation
  - Community contributions
end note

note left of "Storage Formats"
  Multiple format support enables
  interoperability across different
  deep learning frameworks.
end note

note bottom of "Data Flow"
  Data flows from storage through
  processing pipelines to model inputs,
  and outputs flow back to storage.
end note
